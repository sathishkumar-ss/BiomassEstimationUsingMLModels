Overview of the Project [Research based project]
------------------------------------------------
Biomass estimation is essential for effective environmental management and sustainable development initiatives.
However, traditional methods face challenges such as labor intensiveness, limited spatial coverage, and regional specificity.
In response, this study combines machine learning techniques with remote sensing technologies, specifically leveraging the capabilities of Google Earth Engine (GEE).
Various machine learning models including Decision Tree, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, CatBoost, Long Short-Term Memory, Artificial Neural Network, and Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory are employed to map biomass distribution accurately and efficiently.
The proposed approach not only reduces reliance on labor-intensive field measurements but also provides spatially comprehensive biomass maps across large landscapes.
Furthermore, it promotes sustainable forest management practices by enabling non-destructive monitoring and finds the most suitable biomass estimation models with improved accuracy.
Overall, this study underscores the capacity of using Google Earth Engine and machine learning for advancing biomass estimation, thereby contributing to the broader goal of achieving sustainable development.
